## NOTES

**For Small Organizations:**
The Security Officer role can be fulfilled by the same individual serving as Privacy Officer, Compliance Officer, or other leadership role. HIPAA does not require this to be a full-time dedicated position, but the responsibilities must be fulfilled regardless of organization size.

**For Remote/Cloud Organizations:**
Even if your organization operates entirely in the cloud without physical facilities, you must still designate a Security Officer responsible for ePHI security across all cloud services and platforms.

**Annual Review:**
This designation should be reviewed annually to ensure it remains current and the designated individual has the necessary authority and resources to fulfill their responsibilities.

---

**Retention:** This document must be retained for a minimum of **six (6) years** from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later (45 CFR §164.316(b)(2)).
